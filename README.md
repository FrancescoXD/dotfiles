# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

In this repo you can find my old config files (.old_wm dir is for my old i3/sway configs, so don't use them or use them as *kickstart*).  
Now I use dwm, so check my dwm repo (maybe the dwm-flexipatch!), or chadwm (a fork with installation script and other things).

> Go around my profile, because I don't spend so much time updating this repo, I'm sorry!

## Packages
- google-fonts-ttf (or firacode-fonts)
- fish shell
- vim/neovim (see [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim))
- logo-ls (not anymore, but it's nice)
- [volantes cursors](https://github.com/varlesh/volantes-cursors) (see below)

### vim/neovim plugins
- YouCompleteMe (C/Rust code) - needs to be installed manually and requires vim with python3
- NerdTree (icons and git support)
- Gruvbox theme
- lightline

Update (20/02/2023)  
I've made another repo where I use [LazyVim](https://github.com/FrancescoXD/lazyvim-config).

### volantes cursors
When installed, you need to make `~/.icons/default/index.theme` and add this line:
```
[icon theme]
Inherits=volantes_cursors
```
