# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

In this repo you can find my config files (.old_wm dir is for my old i3/sway configs, so don't use them).  
Now I use dwm, so check my dwm repo, or chadwm (a fork with installation script and other things).

## Packages
- fish shell 
- vim/neovim (see [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim))
- logo-ls (not anymore)

### vim/neovim plugins
- YouCompleteMe (C/Rust code) - needs to be installed manually and requires vim with python3
- NerdTree (icons and git support)
- Gruvbox theme
- lightline
